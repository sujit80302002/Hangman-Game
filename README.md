# Hangman-Game
"Created a Python Hangman game - guess the word and avoid the hangman's noose!"

I'm excited to share my Python Hangman game project with you. In this text-based game, I've created a classic and challenging experience where players can test their word-guessing skills.

**Key features of my Hangman game project include:**

Word Selection: The game randomly selects a secret word from a predefined list. Players won't know the word but will see its length represented by underscores.

Guessing: Players take turns guessing letters of the word. If the letter is in the word, it fills in the blanks; if not, it counts as a wrong guess.

Visual Feedback: I've added a hangman ASCII art that gradually appears as players make incorrect guesses, adding a visual element to the game.

Difficulty Levels: To cater to different skill levels, players can choose from easy or hard difficulty levels, which affect the length and complexity of the secret word.

Scorekeeping: The game keeps track of the number of correct and incorrect guesses, encouraging players to aim for a high score.

Word Categories: For variety, I've included word categories (e.g., animals, countries, movies) to keep the game fresh and engaging.

Winning and Losing: Players aim to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn. If they succeed, they win the round; otherwise, they lose.

My Python Hangman game project provides a challenging and enjoyable experience for players to sharpen their word-solving skills. It's a simple yet entertaining way to spend your free time and test your vocabulary. Have fun playing and see if you can beat the hangman!
